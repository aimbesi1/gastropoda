# 🎮 Game Description:
Gastropoda is a 2D platform game that challenges players to overcome obstacles as the misunderstood Snail hunts the lab experiment down. Our hero will be challenged to climb up and down walls, run in dark environments, and use special abilities such as power-ups and weapons across maps. The player's goal is to outpace the Snail and other enemies while reaching for the time-traveling spears that reset the clock for the hero to return to their universe. Although the Snail is slow, it can be challenging to achieve its death.

# 📖 Backstory:
With the pandemic nearing an end, money and greedy actors are determined to descend the world into chaos. Massive corporations such as the World Health Organization and other medical institutions raced to administer the first vaccine into the global fight against the deadly virus; the winner would be rewarded a fortune; unfortunately gullible citizens across the globe voluntarily took part in a series of test trials run by American Aid Organization A.A.O, a wealthy private, clinically approved institution based in Atlanta, Ga, designed by the wealthy to control the distribution of vaccines. A.A.O recognized and contained a gifted volunteer equipped with a special telepathic connection to wildlife. In a desperate attempt to beat W.H.O of the first vaccine, A.A.O scientists conducted unethical biological experiments to unveil the linked powers to the vaccine. During a test that goes wrong where the telepathic connection to animals takes a turn as they become hostile toward everyone. The Volunteers flee to escape the lab. In addition, he discovers that he has extra powers. One of the powers he finds is the ability to tear open a portal across timelines leading him to activate strange abilities out of random; however, the Volunteer learns that the power can guide him to safety. Far away from the failed mutated experiment via time-traveling channels. The Volunteer will end up in a timeline 15 years in the future where A.A.O bested the race appearing as a dominant force in the future. At the same time, the Snail lurks not far behind.

# 🗺️ Level Design
1. 2D side view
2. Four levels with multiple themes from Modern day Laboratory, Ancient Egyptian, WW2 trench, Cyberpunk balcony.
3. The levels will be your basic platformer similar to fallout shelter, celeste
4. The main purpose of the game is to have the player try to overcome obstacles fast enough to not be caught by the ever-approaching snail, so the levels will be built with that in mind.
5. The levels will progress throughout history, as the main character tries to live for eternity. The theming and design of the levels will mirror the time period. For example:
6. First theme will be in the collapsing Laboratory.
7. Ancient egyptian theme will be in a pyramid indiana jones style.
8. A WW2 theme will be centered around the debris of live fire in the trenches.
9. Final level will be cyberpunk theme on a balcony.
10. Each level will have familiar obstacles but the same simple platformer layout that relies on the player’s movement abilities to keep going. Think like geometry dash meets celeste.
